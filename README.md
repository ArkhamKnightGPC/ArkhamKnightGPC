<h1 align="center">Hello :) I'm Gabriel!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Engineering student at Ecole polytechnique</h3>

I'm a 3rd year international student at Ecole polytechnique in the Electrical Engineering specialisation. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of São Paulo before joining Ecole polytechnique on a double degree program. In high school, I participated on many different [science olympiads](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/Certificados_Olimpiadas) and was a gold medalist in the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad.

In my Github page, you'll find projects for university courses at both Ecole polytechnique and the University of São Paulo, and some personal projects!

The goal of this project is to design an ASIC for a single-photon photodetector readout (known as SiPM or Silicon Photo-electron Multiplier). The circuit must perform high speed, low noise amplification and discrimination to allow pico-second timing measurement. The circuit was designed using **Cadence Virtuoso** and a library of TSMC components was used for layout.

- ### [PHY564A: Open Electronics (final project)](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY564A-StepmaniaIoT)
Stepmania based group game project for PHY564A Open Electronics course at Ecole polytechnique. The project has two components: a pygame application running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and a wireless controller based on a ESP32 microcontroller with LED buttons and a 3D case made with Autodesk Fusion. Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the controller is done via Bluetooth Low Energy using GATT notifications.

This mini project was developed on the first few weeks of the Open Electronics course at Ecole polytechnique. A ESP32 MCU captures the reading of an LDR, and communicates sensor data to a Raspberry Pi via MQTT. The Raspberry Pi uses a Fourier Transform to determine if the light readings correspond to natural light or not and sends a message back to the ESP32 via MQTT to lower/raise the blinders (controlled by a step motor).
