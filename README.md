<h1 align="center">Hello :) I'm Gabriel!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Engineering student at Ecole polytechnique</h3>

I'm a 3rd year international student at Ecole polytechnique in the Electrical Engineering specialisation. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of S√£o Paulo before joining Ecole polytechnique on a double degree program. In high school, I participated on many different [science olympiads](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/Certificados_Olimpiadas). 

In my Github page, you'll find several personal projects as well as projects for university courses at both the University of S√£o Paulo and Ecole polytechnique.

### üìì Works in progress:

- ### [INF564](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF564)
Assignments from the Compilation course at Ecole polytechnique. Assignements include: x86 assembly programs, an interpreter for a fragment of the Python language, a parser (made with Jflex and CUP) for a small logo language and a compiler project for a fragment of Java.

- ### [INF567-TDs](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF567-TDs)
Problem sets from the Wireless Networks course at Ecole polytechnique.

- ### [INF567-Project](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF567-Project)
Project developed the Wireless Networks course at Ecole polytechnique. The goal of the project is to make a working Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) prototype.

- ### [Codechef Problems](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/CodechefProblems)
Solutions to Codechef problems! Includes topics in number theory, graphs, fenwick trees, dynamic programming, game theory, greedy algorithms and more!

- ### [PHY581C](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY581C)
The goal of this project is to design an ASIC for a single-photon photodetector readout (known as SiPM or Silicon Photo-electron Multiplier). The circuit must perform high speed, low noise amplification and discrimination to allow pico-second timing measurement. The circuit was designed using **Cadence Virtuoso** and a library of TSMC components was used for layout.

### üè´ Projects from courses at √âcole polytechnique:

- ### [PHY564-Blinder IoT](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY564A-BlinderIoT)
This mini project was developed on the first few weeks of the Open Electronics course at Ecole polytechnique. A ESP32 MCU captures the reading of an LDR, and communicates sensor data to a Raspberry Pi via MQTT. The Raspberry Pi uses a Fourier Transform to determine if the light readings correspond to natural light or not and sends a message back to the ESP32 via MQTT to lower/raise the blinders (controlled by a step motor).

- ### [INF554](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF554)
Jupyter Notebook assignments from the course Machine and Deep learning (with PyTorch) at Ecole polytechnique. Topics covered include: SVMs, MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, Graph Neural Networks.

- ### [INF557](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF557)
Assignments from the course Fundamentals of Computer Networking at Ecole polytechnique. Includes paper assignments in LaTeX with state machines for different transport layer algorithms, message charts as well as coding assignments (introductory tutorials in C, simplified wget command line application and DV routing implementation).

- ### [PHY473R](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY473R)
Handwritten digit detection on FPGA project from the FPGA lab course at √âcole polytechnique. This project implements Rosenblatt's perceptron for binary classification of 0/1 digits on FPGA using VHDL. The project was developed on a Altera DE2-115 board and includes interfaces with a VGA monitor, an LCD and a TRDB-DC2 camera.

- ### [INF421](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF421)
Evolutionary algorithms project for an informatics course at √âcole Polytechnique. Includes complexity proofs using fitness levels and empirical performance analysis on benchmark functions.

- ### [MAP412](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/MAP412)
Problem sets from a numerical analysis course at √âcole polytechnique, includes theoretical proofs for runtime and convergence rates as well as implementations.

- ### [MAP433](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/MAP433)
Problem sets from a statistics course at √âcole polytechnique, includes analysis of the Titanic dataset(DM2) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset(EN3).

- ### [INF442](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF442)
Assignments from the Data Analysis in C++ course at √âcole polytechnique.

- ### [INF443](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF443)
Assignments from the course 3D computer graphics at √âcole polytechnique using ***C++*** and ***OpenGL***.

- ### [PSC](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/drone-swarm-psc)
Group project developed for the [IP Paris Swarm Rescue Competition](https://emmanuel-battesti.github.io/swarm-rescue-website/). The project consists of a comparative analysis of different approaches to teach a swarm of drones how to behave to save a maximum of injured people in a minimum of time on a simulated environment.

### üíª Some of my other projects on GitHub:

- ### [Competitive Programming notebook](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/CadernoArkhamICPC)
Solutions to competitive programming problems, featuring algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet Trees, and the Aho-Corasick automaton.

- ### [IP Tracker](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/RastreadorIP)
IP Tracker made using Next.js and the **react-leaflet** package.

- ### [Security system](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/sistema-seguranca)
VHDL project for a security system using an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor. Can be controlled using a Processing application through MQTT messaging.

- ### [Bare metal process switching](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/ChaveamentoProcessos)
Bare metal application implementing process switching in an ARM based processor emulator.

- ### [KBD-ARM-Versatile](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/KBD-ARM-Versatile)
