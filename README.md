<h1 align="center">Hello :) I'm Gabriel!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Engineering student at √âcole Polytechnique</h3>

I'm a 2nd year international student at √âcole Polytechnique, pursuing my engineering degree. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of S√£o Paulo.

My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in theoretical courses such as Electrical Circuits, Control Systems, Signals and Systems, and Algorithms & Data Structures. I've also gained practical experience through labs, including Digital Systems Lab with VHDL and Microprocessor Lab with ARM Assembly projects. Currently, I'm on a double degree program at √âcole Polytechnique.

üì´ Feel free to reach out to me at gabriel.pereira-de-carvalho@polytechnique.edu
