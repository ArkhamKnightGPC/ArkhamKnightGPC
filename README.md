<h1 align="center">Hello :) I'm Gabriel!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Engineering student at Ecole polytechnique</h3>

I'm a 3rd year international student at Ecole polytechnique in the Electrical Engineering specialisation. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of São Paulo before joining Ecole polytechnique on a double degree program. In high school, I participated on many different [science olympiads](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/Certificados_Olimpiadas). I was gold medalist in the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad and I love solving competitive programming problems.

In my Github page, you'll find projects for university courses at both Ecole polytechnique and the University of São Paulo, and some personal projects!

- ### [INF567-TDs](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF567-TDs)
Problem sets from the Wireless Networks course at Ecole polytechnique.

- ### [INF567-Project](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF567-Project)
Project developed the Wireless Networks course at Ecole polytechnique. The goal of the project is to make a working Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) prototype.

- ### [Codechef Problems](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/CodechefProblems)
Solutions to Codechef problems! Includes topics in number theory, graphs, fenwick trees, dynamic programming, game theory, greedy algorithms and more!

- ### [PHY581C](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY581C)
The goal of this project is to design an ASIC for a single-photon photodetector readout (known as SiPM or Silicon Photo-electron Multiplier). The circuit must perform high speed, low noise amplification and discrimination to allow pico-second timing measurement. The circuit was designed using **Cadence Virtuoso** and a library of TSMC components was used for layout.

- ### [PHY564A](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY564A-StepmaniaIoT)
Stepmania based group game project for PHY564A Open Electronics course at Ecole polytechnique. The project explores wireless time synchronisation between the two ESP32 in the controllers and the Raspberry Pi running the core of the game.

### 💻❤️ Some of my other projects on Github:

- ### [Competitive Programming notebook](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/CadernoArkhamICPC)
Solutions to competitive programming problems. Includes C++ implementations of Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet Trees, the Aho-Corasick automaton, Dynamic connectivity, Reachability Trees, Heavy-Light decomposition, Manacher's algorithm, Li Chao Trees for the Convex Hull Optimization technique in dynamic programming problems, Merge Sort Trees, Persistent Segment Trees, Fast Kuhn algorithm for the maximum bipartite matching problem, Treaps (randomized binary search trees).

- ### [PHY564-Blinder IoT](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/PHY564A-BlinderIoT)
This mini project was developed on the first few weeks of the Open Electronics course at Ecole polytechnique. A ESP32 MCU captures the reading of an LDR, and communicates sensor data to a Raspberry Pi via MQTT. The Raspberry Pi uses a Fourier Transform to determine if the light readings correspond to natural light or not and sends a message back to the ESP32 via MQTT to lower/raise the blinders (controlled by a step motor).

- ### [INF554](https://github.com/ArkhamKnightGPC/INF554)
